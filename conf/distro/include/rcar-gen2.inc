# To build for the rcar devices you must install the binary gpu drivers as
# follows. These are made available under the name R-Car Series Evaluation
# Software Package for Linux at the following address:
#
#   http://www.renesas.com/secret/r_car_download/rcar_demoboard.jsp
#
# You need two files named as follows:
#  - R-Car_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_for_Linux-<yyyymmdd>.zip
#  - R-Car_Series_Evaluation_Software_Package_of_Linux_Drivers-<yyyymmdd>.zip
#
# You can place them in any location, below ~/Downloads is assumed. Now do
# the following:
#
#   $ mkdir build && cd build
#   $ export MACHINE=YourMachineHere
#   $ ~/meta-boot2qt/b2qt-init-build-env init --device $MACHINE
#   $ cd sources/meta-renesas
#   $ ./meta-rcar-gen2/docs/sample/copyscript/copy_eva_sw_pkgs.sh ~/Downloads
#
# The script takes as the sole argument the location of the two zips. You must
# be in the right directory when you call the script!
#
# You can now build as usual:
#   $ cd ../..
#   $ . setup-environment.sh
#   $ bitbake b2qt-embedded-image
#

# internal copy of R-Car_Series_Evaluation_Software_Packages used for CI
